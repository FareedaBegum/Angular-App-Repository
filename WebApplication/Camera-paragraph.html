    <h1>Nested Views Home Page</h1>
    <h2>Paragraph</h2>
    <label>
        Let’s look at how we can nest views. We’ll add two buttons to our home page and from there, we will want to show off different information based on what
        is clicked. We’re going to add our buttons to partial-home.html and then go into our Angular file and see how we can change it to add nested views.
